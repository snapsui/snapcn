Snap UI extends the robust, customizable components of shadcn/ui by introducing smooth, built-in animations. Now, you can create dynamic, engaging user interfaces by combining the simplicity and power of shadcn components with snapcn’s animation enhancements.

## Inspiration and Approach

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com): Snap cn builds upon the foundation of shadcn/ui by integrating animation functionality while preserving the core idea of providing easy-to-use, customizable components.

Much like shadcn/ui, Snap UI puts you in control, but with added animation capabilities to make interactions more fluid and visually appealing.

## Key Features

- **Shadcn components with Snapcn animations**: All shadcn components are extended with smooth, customizable animations for a more interactive user experience.

- **Copy and Paste Components**: Instead of relying on package dependencies, Snap UI allows you to copy components directly into your project. This approach gives you complete ownership of the code and the freedom to modify it as needed.

- **No NPM Package**: We have no plans to distribute Snap UI as an npm package. This decision aligns with our goal of maximum flexibility and customization.

## Getting Started
