Snap UI is a curated set of versatile components designed to streamline the creation of landing pages and other user-focused interfaces. The collection is purpose-built to accelerate your design workflow by providing components that can be easily adapted to your projects.

## Vision

We believe that thoughtful design plays a pivotal role in shaping the perception of your product. The way you present your brand to users builds confidence, which is critical in turning visitors into loyal customers.

A well-crafted design communicates professionalism and reliability. When users encounter clean, intuitive interfaces, they feel reassured that the product is built by a capable and detail-oriented team. This assurance often extends to the expectation of quality service and support.

On the other hand, poor design can undermine your efforts, sending a signal of inattention to detail. An unpolished interface can create doubts about the stability of your product and the competency of your team.

Our goal with Snap UI is to help you create polished, high-quality experiences that leave a positive impression on every user. A good design doesn’t just look pretty; it fosters trust, credibility, and lasting relationships with your audience.

Inspired by https://ui.shadcn.com, this collection focuses on simplicity, flexibility, and ease of integration.

## What is Snap UI?

Unlike traditional component libraries, Snap UI is not distributed via npm or as a package dependency. Instead, it offers a library of standalone components that you can copy directly into your project and modify to your needs.

#### Why Copy/Paste Components?

We want to give you full ownership of the code. By copying components into your project, you're free to customize the design, behavior, and structure to fit your specific needs. This approach allows you to start with best practices while avoiding the limitations often imposed by pre-packaged solutions.

#### No Plans for NPM Package

Snap UI was created to give you maximum flexibility, so we have no intention of turning it into an npm package. Instead, we encourage developers to tweak and adjust the components however they see fit.

#### Supported Frameworks

Snap UI components are built with React, meaning they can be integrated into any modern framework that supports React and Next.js.

#### Free to Use

These components are open for use in both personal and commercial projects without any attribution required. However, if you build something awesome, we’d love to hear about it!
