Snap UI is a collection of adaptable components inspired by the excellent work of shadcn/ui. Our goal is to provide you with a solid foundation for creating sleek, user-centric interfaces while maintaining the flexibility to tailor each component to your specific needs.

## Inspiration and Approach

- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com): We've embraced their philosophy of providing components that are easy to understand, customize, and integrate into your projects.

- [Aceternity UI](https://ui.aceternity.com) by Manu Arora: We've been inspired by Manu's modern, sleek design approach and innovative component ideas.

- [Magic UI](https://magicui.design) by Dhillon: Dhillon's work has influenced our thinking on component structure and user interaction patterns.

Like these inspirational projects, we believe in giving developers full control over their UI components while providing a strong foundation to build upon.

## Key Features

- **Copy and Paste Components**: Instead of relying on package dependencies, Snap UI allows you to copy components directly into your project. This approach gives you complete ownership of the code and the freedom to modify it as needed.

- **No NPM Package**: We have no plans to distribute Snap UI as an npm package. This decision aligns with our goal of maximum flexibility and customization.

## Getting Started

To begin using Snap UI, simply browse our component library and copy the code for the components you need directly into your project. From there, you're free to customize and extend the components to fit your specific requirements.
